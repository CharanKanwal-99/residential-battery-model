# residential-battery-savings
This project analyzes the savings associated with Residential Batteries in California under the different tariff plans of different utilities. Since there is significant solar penetration in California, there is an option to calculate savings with and without solar pairing. Two major aspects of the analysis are the load and generation profiles. Pvwatts has been used for getting the user's solar generation profiles while the DOE's EnergyPlus model is used to get load profiles based on building and weather data. A flask app has been created for the calculation of savings
